Where `childScript` holds the actual command to execute and `parentScript` sets the environment variables to use. Then instead of run the childScript you run the parent. This is quite useful for launching the same command with different env variables or when the environment variables are too long to have everything in one line. It also means that you can use `$GREET` env var syntax even on Windows which would usually require it to be `%GREET%`.
